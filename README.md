Navigate to my **Wiki** tab for the ROMs and content review (work in progress...)  
[iMac - Nvidia Kepler ROMs Wiki](https://github.com/nikey22/imac-uga-roms/wiki)  

you will find links to the patched vbios ROMs and various examples of implementations in Mac OS systems.   
Please also review the following thread and study page 1 of its own Wiki: [Macrumors - 2011-imac-graphics-card-upgrade](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2011-imac-graphics-card-upgrade.1596614/)
